# PHASE 05 — Core API Endpoints

### 05.01 API Design & OpenAPI Spec

#### Objective
To successfully implement API Design & OpenAPI Spec as part of PHASE 05 — Core API Endpoints. This ensures that the platform correctly handles this component in the end-to-end lifecycle.

#### Why
This is required because without it, the product layer remains incomplete and disconnected from the underlying ML engine. It fulfills a critical requirement for a production-grade Explainable AI Cybersecurity Platform.

#### Prerequisites
- All previous phases up to 05.00 must be completed.
- Existing ML repository structure must be intact.

#### Depends On
05.00 (or previous phase if this is the first sub-phase).

#### Files / Modules
- `apps/` frontend boundaries (web/admin)
- `services/api/` (FastAPI backend)
- Database schema / Redis store
- ML artifacts (`ml/artifacts/`)

#### What To Implement
1. Analyze existing research/ML code related to this sub-phase.
2. Design the product layer (API, Schema, UI).
3. Connect the frontend to the backend API.
4. Integrate the ML component where applicable.

#### How To Implement
1. **Design**: Draft the interface or schema.
2. **Backend**: Implement the FastAPI route and SQLAlchemy model.
3. **ML Integration**: Load the required artifacts or utilities from the `ml/` package.
4. **Frontend**: Create the UI components in Next.js using shadcn/ui.
5. **State**: Connect via TanStack Query / Zustand.

#### Data Flow
USER -> Next.js Frontend -> FastAPI -> Database/Redis -> ML Inference/XAI Engine -> Response -> USER

#### API / Backend Impact
Requires endpoints to handle requests securely, validate input with Pydantic, and process the logic asynchronously if latency > 500ms.

#### Frontend / UI Impact
Requires responsive, accessible components displaying loading/error/success states.

#### Database Impact
May require Alembic migrations and new SQLAlchemy models to persist state.

#### ML Impact
Leverages the existing working ML implementation. The models, preprocessing, and XAI utilities are treated as read-only or invoked via wrappers.

#### Security Considerations
- Input validation (Pydantic).
- RBAC authorization checks.
- Sanitization of data.
- Rate limiting.

#### Testing
- Unit tests for logic.
- Integration tests for API.
- E2E tests for UI flows.

#### Validation
Developer must manually verify the UI flow, check the database records, and verify API responses in Swagger/Postman.

#### Expected Result
A fully functioning API Design & OpenAPI Spec feature that integrates smoothly into the larger cybersecurity platform.

#### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Code implemented.
- [ ] Tests passing.
- [ ] Security reviewed.
- [ ] API documented.
- [ ] UI states handled (loading, error, empty).

#### Next Step
Proceed to Phase 05.02 to continue the implementation sequence.
